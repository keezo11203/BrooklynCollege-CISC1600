<h1> About Me</h1>

<a href="./index.html">Home</a>

<p> My full name is <b>Kaitlyn Elee Ellis.</b></p>
<p> I would describe myself as a kind, understanding person who wants the best for everyone. Alot of my friends say I am a pretty funny and nice person who helps them whenever they need something. One of my best qualities would have to be my music taste. People always say I make the best playlists. Another one of my good qualities is the fact that I am a very caring person. I learned how to take my grandmother's blood sugar and pressure, and how to monitor her medicine after she got out the hospital.</p>
